# Replication Package
>#### Women, World Society, and the Expansion of Academic Knowledge in Education.

---
This is a working project directory and will be made into a stable reproduction package, _eventually_. 

---
## To Do

1. convert notebook to pys
1. get all jstor data
1. write purpose
1. write out rep steps 
1. consider inferential modeling
1. consider smaller scope (cer only?)
1. put data on dataverse

## Project Organization

Below is a map of the directory with annotations for general orientation.
